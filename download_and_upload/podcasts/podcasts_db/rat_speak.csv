"Rationally Speaking #137 - Marc Lipsitch on, ""Should scientists try to create dangerous viruses?""","<p>A controversial field of research is ""gain-of-function,"" in which scientists take a virus (like a strain of flu) and attempt to make it more dangerous, for example by making it transmissible in mammals when it had previously been solely an avian flu. The motivation is to learn how viruses might mutate in nature so that we can be prepared -- but what if those engineered ""superbugs"" escape the lab and start a pandemic? In this episode of Rationally Speaking, Harvard professor of epidemiology Marc Lipsitch argues that the risks outweigh the benefits, and that we should halt gain-of-function research as soon as possible.</p> <p>Marc Lipsitch is Professor of Epidemiology with primary appointment in the Department of Epidemiology and a joint appointment in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases.

Massimo introduces some of the early philosophical approaches to this puzzle, and then Massimo and Julia go over more recent scientific research on the issue (for example: does resisting temptation deplete your reserves of willpower, or does it strengthen your willpower ""muscle""?).

Rationally Speaking #59 - Live at NECSS: David Kyle Johnson on the Simulation Argument,"In this special live episode recorded at the 2012 Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism, Massimo and Julia discuss the ""simulation argument"" -- the case that it's roughly 20% likely that we live in a computer simulation -- and the surprising implications that argument has for religion. Their guest is philosopher David Kyle Johnson, who is professor of philosophy at King's College and author of the blog ""Plato on Pop"" for Psychology Today, and who hosts his own podcast at philosophyandpopculture.com. Elaborating on an article he recently published in the journal Philo, Johnson lays out the simulation argument and his own insight into how it might solve the age-old Problem of Evil (i.e., ""How is it possible that an all-powerful, all-knowing, and good God could allow evil to occur in the world?"").

Rationally Speaking #57 - Peer Review,"If you value scientific evidence you're probably familiar with the idea that having ""peer-reviewed"" studies is crucial to the legitimacy of any new claim. But what does ""peer-reviewed"" entail, anyway? In this episode, Massimo and Julia open up the black box of peer review, explaining how the process originated, how it works, and what's wrong with it. They also try brainstorming ways it could be fixed, and ask: how is the Internet changing the way we do research?",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/5/6/b/f56bdf62d8937eb4/bannersquare300.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/rationallyspeakingpodcast/rs57.mp3?dest-id=182214,False,not_uploaded
Rationally Speaking #56 - Howard Schneider on Science News Literacy,"M & J discuss science communication with Howard Schneider, dean of the school of journalism at SUNY Stonybrook and former editor of Newsday. A guest at previous skeptic events, including the first annual Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism, Schneider has argued in the past that skeptics lay too much blame at the feet of the media for public misunderstandings and misconceptions about science. Julia and Massimo question him on this point, and ask him for his thoughts on what *can* be done to improve scientific literacy. As the founder of the Center for News Literacy and the Center for Communicating Science, Schneider has plenty of thoughts to share -- including making scientists take improv classes. Should science communication involve more storytelling? And is there any way to take advantage of new, online media formats to remedy some of the weak points in the science communication process?",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/5/6/b/f56bdf62d8937eb4/bannersquare300.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/rationallyspeakingpodcast/rs56.mp3?dest-id=182214,False,not_uploaded
Rationally Speaking #55 - Spirituality,"Is ""rational spirituality"" a contradiction? In this episode, Massimo and Julia try to pin down what people mean when they call themselves ""spiritual,"" what inspires spiritual experiences and attitudes, and whether spirituality can be compatible with a naturalist view of the world. Are there benefits that skeptics and other secular people could possibly get from incorporating some variants on traditional spiritual practices -- like prayer, ritual, song, communal worship, and so on -- into their own lives? Massimo and Julia examine a variety of attempts to do so, and ask: how well have such attempts worked, and do they come with any potential pitfalls for our rationality?",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/5/6/b/f56bdf62d8937eb4/bannersquare300.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/rationallyspeakingpodcast/rs55.mp3?dest-id=182214,False,not_uploaded
Rationally Speaking #54 - The 'isms' Episode,"n this episode Massimo and Julia ask, ""Is the fundamental nature of the world knowable by science alone?"", looking at the issue through the lenses of a series of related philosophical positions: determinism, reductionism, physicalism, and naturalism. All of those ""isms"" take a stance on the question of whether there are objectively ""correct"" ways to interpret scientific facts -- like physical laws, or causality -- and if so, how do we decide what the correct interpretation is? Along the way, Massimo and Julia debate the nature of emergent properties, whether math is discovered or invented, and whether it's even logically possible for ""supernatural"" things to exist.",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/5/6/b/f56bdf62d8937eb4/bannersquare300.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/rationallyspeakingpodcast/rs54.mp3?dest-id=182214,False,not_uploaded
Rationally Speaking #53 - Parapsychology,"In this episode, Massimo and Julia take on parapsychology, the study of phenomena such as extrasensory perception, precognition, and remote viewing. Its practitioners claim that there is more evidence for it than there is for other areas of scientific inquiry, such as string theory for which there is no empirical data at all. Yet string theory is taken seriously as a science whereas parapsychology is not. So, what is the scientific status of parapsychology? What does the best academic literature on the subject tell us? Finally, what can we learn from parapsychology about the practice of science in general?",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/5/6/b/f56bdf62d8937eb4/bannersquare300.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/rationallyspeakingpodcast/rs53.mp3?dest-id=182214,False,not_uploaded

Rationally Speaking #50 - Neurobabble,"The media is increasingly bombarding us with reports of advances in neuroscience which claim all sorts of amazing feats, like allowing us to read our thoughts and intentions. It sounds like neurobabble. Most of these reports though are either based on bad science, reach false conclusion, or are based on conceptual misunderstanding of how our psychology works. To be fair, much of this is manufactured by the popular media but, unfortunately, some of it comes from the neuroscience community itself. So, what information can we really get from fMRIs? As with the misunderstanding of what genes are (like whether there is a God or a conservative gene), are there really parts of the brain dedicated to categories of thoughts like some of these reports claim? And, perhaps more importantly, what are the ethical implications of this neurobabble, should we arrest people who we can tell, based on this research, will be committing a crime?",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/5/6/b/f56bdf62d8937eb4/bannersquare300.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/rationallyspeakingpodcast/rs50.mp3?dest-id=182214,True,"1.1752873563218391, 1.0"
Rationally Speaking #49 - Eugenie C. Scott on Denialism of Climate Change and Evolution,"<p>Our guest Eugenie C. Scott joins us to talk about a new initiative of the National Center for Science Education (NCSE) to tackle denialism of global warming. Both evolution and global warming are “controversial issues” in the public sphere, but are not controversial in the world of science. There is some overlap between the two issues, but far more people are climate change deniers than evolution deniers. What is interesting to skeptics, however, is the similarity in the techniques that are used by both camps to promote their views. The scientific issues are presented as “not being settled,” or that there is considerable debate among scientists over the validity of claims.</p> <p>Evolution and global warming opponents also demonize the opposition by accusing them of fraud or other wrong-doing. Denialists in both camps practice “anomaly mongering,” in which a small detail seemingly incompatible with either evolution or global warming is considered to undermine either evolution or climate science. Although in both cases, reputable, established science is under attack for ideological reasons, the underlying ideology differs: for creationism, the ideology of course is religious; for global warming, the ideology is political and/or economic.</p> <p>Dr. Eugenie C. Scott is Executive Director of the National Center for Science Education, and sits on the Board of Advisors for the New York City Skeptics. She has written extensively on the evolution-creationism controversy and is past president of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists. Scott is the 2010 recipient of the National Academy of Science's Public Welfare Medal.

Rationally Speaking #48 - Philosophical Counseling,"<p>Our guest Lou Marinoff joins us to discuss philosophical counceling, a recent trend to use philosophy as a type of talk therapy. Now, despite the provocative title of his best-selling book, “Plato, Not Prozac!: Applying Eternal Wisdom to Everyday Problems,” the idea is actually not to replace psychiatric medications with chats about the ancient Greeks. Rather, as he puts it in the introduction to the volume, you should take your medications if you really need them, but once your brain is back to a normal functionality you will likely still be faced with the same existential problems that plague most human beings. And that’s where philosophy might help.</p> <p>Lou Marinoff is the Chair of the Department of Philosophy at The City College of New York and a founder of the American Philosophical Practitioners Association.

In this episode, Massimo and Julia take us trough the history of skepticism. From its roots in ancient Greece, to Descartes, the last rationalist, to David Hume, the father of modern skepticism, and to today's modern skeptic movement. Also, is anything really knowable?

Then there are the many moral dimensions of science practice, both in terms of ethical issues internal to science (fraud) and of the much broader ones affecting society at large (societal consequences of research and technological advances).

Rationally Speaking #31 - Vegetarianism,"Vegetarianism is a complex set of beliefs and practices, spanning from the extreme “fruitarianism,” where people only eat fruits and other plant parts that can be gathered without “harming” the plant, to various forms of “flexitaranism,” like pollotarianism (poultry is okay to eat) and pescetarianism (fish okay). So, what does science have to say about this? What is the ethical case for vegetarianism? And, is it true that vegetarians are more intelligent than omnivores?

Rationally Speaking #30 - Cordelia Fine on Delusions of Gender,"<p>Cordelia Fine joins us from Melbourne, Australia to discuss her book: ""Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences."" Sex discrimination is supposedly a distant memory, yet popular books, magazines and even scientific articles increasingly defend inequalities by citing immutable biological differences between the male and female brain. That’s the reason, we’re told, that there are so few women in science and engineering and so few men in the laundry room — different brains are just better suited to different things. Drawing on the latest research in developmental psychology, neuroscience, and social psychology, Fine sets out to rebut these claims, showing how old myths, dressed up in new scientific finery, are helping to perpetuate the sexist status quo.</p> <p>Cordelia Fine studied Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, followed by an M.Phil in Criminology at Cambridge University. She was awarded a Ph.D in Psychology from University College London. She is currently a Senior Research Associate at the Centre for Agency, Values & Ethics at Macquarie University, and an Honorary Research Fellow at the Department of Psychological Sciences at the University of Melbourne.

The revised statement says that “the purposes of the association shall be to advance public understanding of humankind in all its aspects,” a wording that opens the possibility for cultural anthropologists to engage in public advocacy on behalf of cultures they are studying.

To begin with, how is this different from classical studies of gene-culture co-evolution? Second, what, exactly are memes, i.e. what is their ontological status? Third, how do memes compete with each other, and for what resources? Is it even possible to build a functional ecology of memes, without which the statement that the most fit memes are those that spread becomes an empty tautology?

Welcome to evolutionary psychology, a discipline curiously situated at the interface between evolutionary science and pop psychology, where both wild and reasonable claims seem to clash against the wall of an incredible scarcity of pertinent data.</p> <p>The issue is not whether it makes sense to apply evolutionary principles to the study of human behavior.

Well, it turns out that superstition may, at least some of the time, have beneficial effects. A paper published in 2008 in Science for example, suggests that lacking control over a situation increases people’s propensity to see illusory patterns — the implication being that the latter (a typical component of superstition) ameliorates stress when we feel that things are out of hand. Also, a recent study published in Psychological Science shows that superstition improves people’s performance on certain tasks, presumably by making them more self-confident than they would be otherwise. Add to this a recent article in Scientific American to the effect that people with Asperger’s syndrome are less likely to project agency onto life’s events (and hence tend to be less superstitious), and suddenly the skeptic might not feel so cocky about being skeptical.</p> <p>Of course we're not advocating in favor of superstition on the sole ground that it may be psychologically helpful.

Rationally Speaking #12 - What About Thought Experiments?,"<p>Philosophers are often accused of engaging in armchair speculation, as far removed from reality as possible. The quintessential example of this practice is the thought experiment, which many scientists sneer at precisely because it doesn’t require one to get one’s hands dirty. And yet scientists have often engaged in thought experiments, some of which have marked major advances in our understanding of the world. Just consider the famous example of Galileo’s thought experiment demonstrating (rather counter intuitively) that two objects of different weight must fall at the same speed. And, perhaps more famously, Einstein's light thought experiments, which lead him to the formulation of the theory of relativity.</p> <p>And then, there are the other kind, like philosopher David Chalmers' famous thought experiment about zombies and the so-called ""hard problem"" of consciousness. Chalmers comes up with an (admittedly ingenious) little story, and we are supposed to deduce from it the momentous conclusion that there is more than matter/energy to the universe? Still, there are plenty of good thought experiments in philosophy, beginning with the so-called trolley dilemmas meant to probe our moral intuitions.</p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/5/6/b/f56bdf62d8937eb4/bannersquare300.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/rationallyspeakingpodcast/rs12.mp3?dest-id=182214,True,"1.0, 1.0472964405398064"

Rationally Speaking #8 - The Anthropic Principle,"<p>The Anthropic Principle (AP), in its many forms, attempts to explain why our observations of the physical universe are compatible with the life observed in it. From the Weak AP (WAP), which in one form states that ""conditions that are observed in the universe must allow the observer to exist"", to the Strong AP (SAP) which in one version states that: “The Universe (and hence the fundamental parameters on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage,” they all try to answer the question of why there is life in the universe, or why the fundamental constants are the way they are. But, do any of these principles add anything to our understanding of the ultimate question of life and the universe?</p> <p>Perhaps the best answer is embedded in Martin Gardner’s sarcastic proposal of the Completely Ridiculous Anthropic Principle (CRAP): “At the instant the Omega Point is reached, life will have gained control of all matter and forces not only in a single universe, but in all universes whose existence is logically possible; life will have spread into all spatial regions in all universes which could logically exist, and will have stored an infinite amount of information, including all bits of knowledge which it is logically possible to know.

Also, Karen Armstrong, author of ""The Case for God"", and Krista Tippett, author of ""Einstein's God"" and host of National Public Radio's ""Speaking of Faith"", where scientific notions are regularly distorted and mixed up with barely intelligible mystical “insights” that are put forward as profound truths.</p> <p>The question is not only whether there is anything interesting in what these people are saying, but rather the much more difficult issue of why it is that smart individuals, who make their living thinking and writing about science and philosophy, are attracted by fluffy thinking.</p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/5/6/b/f56bdf62d8937eb4/bannersquare300.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/rationallyspeakingpodcast/rs06.mp3?dest-id=182214,True,"1.0290346948112052, 1.0"
Rationally Speaking #5 - Neil deGrasse Tyson and the Need for a Space Program,"<p>Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson joins Massimo and Julia to discuss the need for a space program. Many scientists (and most people in the skeptic community) simply assume that funding outlets like NASA are a good idea. But, can scientists justify the enormous expense involved, not just in terms of their personal curiosity, but as a matter of tangible and intangible benefits to society at large? Should we go back to the Moon and establish a permanent base? Is it worth the expense and likely risk to human life to attempt a mission to Mars? What is a space station for, anyway?</p> <p>Dr. Tyson is an astrophysicist by training and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. He is also the host of PBS's science NOW. His latest book is “The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet.”</p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/5/6/b/f56bdf62d8937eb4/bannersquare300.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/rationallyspeakingpodcast/rs05.mp3?dest-id=182214,True,"1.0, 1.0"
Rationally Speaking #4 - The Great Atheist Debate Over the Limits of Science,"""Accommodationist"" is a word that began to appear in recent months during public debates over science and religion. The derogatory term has been applied to atheists and rationalists like Eugenie Scott, at the National Center for Science Education, and Chris Mooney, science writer at Discover Magazine, who maintain that science and faith are not necessarily incompatible. Although the debate is frequently framed as a practical one, about what the tactics of the secular movement should be, it is also a philosophical one, hinging on the question of the epistemic limits of science. In this episode, we examine the arguments being made by and against the so-called ""accommodationists,"" and ask: Can science disprove religious and supernatural claims?",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/5/6/b/f56bdf62d8937eb4/bannersquare300.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/rationallyspeakingpodcast/rs04.mp3?dest-id=182214,True,"1.0, 1.007676130389064"
Rationally Speaking #3 - Can History Be a Science?,"Our guest, Prof. Peter Turchin from the University of Connecticut, joins Massimo and Julia to discuss whether history can be studied and understood in a scientific manner. In an article in Nature (3 July 2008) on what he termed “cliodynamics,” he discusses the possibility of turning history into a science. In it, he proposes that history, contrary to what most historians might think -- is not just one damn thing after another, that there are regular and predictable patterns, from which we can learn and that we can predict. Of course, he is not the only scientist to have turned to history in an attempt to make that field more scientific, Jared Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse immediately come to mind. And naturally, many historians vehemently object to what they perceive as a crude scientistic attempt at interdisciplinary colonization.",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/5/6/b/f56bdf62d8937eb4/bannersquare300.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/rationallyspeakingpodcast/rs03.mp3?dest-id=182214,True,"1.0, 1.295973132264331"
"Rationally Speaking #2 - Love, a Skeptical Inquiry","Will science ever really be able to explain love? Science has already found correlations between particular hormones and certain forms or stages of love. However, no matter how many correlations we find between brain activity and love, correlation does not imply causation. And what does it mean to explain love scientifically -- would that change our attitude towards it? We realize that raising this subject risks fueling the widespread and irritating misconception that “skeptic” = “cynical killjoy,” which is the last thing we want to do. As good skeptics though, what do we do when faced with a mysterious and unexplained phenomenon? We look for explanations!",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/5/6/b/f56bdf62d8937eb4/bannersquare300.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/rationallyspeakingpodcast/rs02.mp3?dest-id=182214,True,"1.1292420136441905, 1.0"
Rationally Speaking #1 - Why be rational?,"Why is ""speaking rationally"" a worthwhile goal anyway? It’s not self-evident, at least not to many people. Human beings certainly don’t seem made for it. Aristotle may have famously dubbed us ""the rational animal,"" but cognitive science tells a different story, with plenty of evidence that our brains blithely flout logic all the time and are excellent at rationalizing our irrational decisions after the fact. Indeed, it is reasonable to ask why fight our irrational natures to begin with? After all, some argue that irrationality can make us happier, at least in certain situations. Then again, perhaps there is a problem with the whole idea of arguing for irrationality...",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/5/6/b/f56bdf62d8937eb4/bannersquare300.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/rationallyspeakingpodcast/rs01.mp3?dest-id=182214,True,"1.0427557209815272, 1.0"

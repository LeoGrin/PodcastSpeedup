0,Audrey Tang on the Technology of Democracy,"<p>Audrey Tang began reading classical works like the <em>Shūjīng</em> and <em>Tao Te Ching</em> at the age of 5 and learned the programming language Perl at the age of 12. Now, the autodidact and self-described “conservative anarchist” is a software engineer and the first non-binary digital minister of Taiwan. Their work focuses on how social and digital technologies can foster empathy, democracy, and human progress.</p> <p>Audrey joined Tyler to discuss how Taiwan approached regulating Chinese tech companies, the inherent extraterritoriality of data norms, how <em>Finnegans Wake</em> has influenced their approach to technology, the benefits of radical transparency in communication, why they appreciate the laziness of Perl, using “humor over rumor” to combat online disinformation, why Taiwan views democracy as a set of social technologies, how their politics have been influenced by Taiwan’s indigenous communities and their oral culture, what Chinese literature teaches about change, how they view Confucianism as a Daoist, how they would improve Taiwanese education, why they view mistakes in the American experiment as inevitable – but not insurmountable, the role of civic tech in Taiwan’s pandemic response, the most important remnants of Japanese influence remaining in Taiwan, why they love Magic: The Gathering, the transculturalism that makes Taiwan particularly open and accepting of LGBT lifestyles, growing up with parents who were journalists, how being transgender makes them more empathetic, the ways American values still underpin the internet, what they learned from previous Occupy movements, why translation, rotation, and scaling are important skills for becoming a better thinker, and more.</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Follow us on</span> <a href= ""https://twitter.com/cowenconvos""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">Twitter</span></a> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">and</span> <a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">IG</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: @cowenconvos </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Email:</span> <a href= ""mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</span></a></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/audreyt"">Audrey</a> on Twitter</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Follow</span> <a href= ""https://twitter.com/tylercowen""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">Tyler</span></a> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">on Twitter</span></p> <p><a href=""https://facebook.com/cowenconvos""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">Facebook</span></a></p> <p><a href=""https://mercatus.org/newsletters""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">Newsletter</span></a></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/d/1/6/f/d16f58f3f69e86f4/CWT-112-AudreyTang-Libsyn.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/CWT-112-AudreyTang-podcast-v1.mp3?dest-id=850607,False
1,"Alex Ross on Music, Culture, and Criticism","<p>To Alex Ross, good music critics must be well-rounded and have command of neighboring cultural areas. “When you're writing about opera, you're writing about literature as well as music, you're writing about staging, theater ideas, as well as music,” says the veteran music journalist and staff writer for <em>The New Yorker</em>. His most recent book, <a href= ""https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374285934/?ots=1&slotNum=2&imprToken=dcba4bba-229b-9a4a-857&tag=thneyo0f-20""> <em>Wagnerism: Art and Politics in the Shadow of Music</em></a>, explores the complicated legacy of Wagner, as well as how music shapes and is shaped by its cultural context.</p> <p>Alex joined Tyler to discuss the book, what gets lost in the training of modern opera singers, the effect of recording technology on orchestras, why he doesn’t have “guilty pleasures,” how we should approach Wagner today, the irony behind most uses of “Ride of the Valkyries” in cinema, his favorite Orson Welles film, his predictions for concert attendance after COVID-19, why artistic life in Europe will likely recover faster than in America, Rothko’s influence on composer Morton Feldman, his contender for the greatest pop album ever made, how his Harvard dissertation on James Joyce prepared him for a career writing about music, and more.</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Follow us on</span> <a href= ""https://twitter.com/cowenconvos""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">Twitter</span></a> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">and</span> <a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">IG</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: @cowenconvos </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Email:</span> <a href= ""mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</span></a></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/alexrossmusic?lang=en"">Alex</a> on Twitter</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Follow</span> <a href= ""https://twitter.com/tylercowen""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">Tyler</span></a> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">on Twitter</span></p> <p><a href=""https://facebook.com/cowenconvos""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">Facebook</span></a></p> <p><a href=""https://mercatus.org/newsletters""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">Newsletter</span></a></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/4/6/d/c/46dc25d12f7e8932/CWT-108-AlexRoss-Libsyn.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/CWT-108-AlexRoss-v5.mp3?dest-id=850607,False

3,"Jason Furman on Productivity, Competition, and Growth","<p><em>Note: This conversation was recorded in January 2020.</em></p> <p>Tyler credits Jason Furman’s intellectual breadth, real-world experience, and emphasis on policy for making him the best economist in the world. Furman, despite not initially being interested in public policy, ultimately served as the chair of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Obama thanks to a call from Joe Stiglitz while still in grad school. His perspective is as idiosyncratic as his career trajectory, seeing the world of economic policy as a series of complex tradeoffs rather than something reducible to oversimplified political slogans.</p> <p>Jason joined Tyler for a wide-ranging conversation on how monopolies affect investment patterns, his top three recommendations to improve American productivity, why he’s skeptical of place-based development policies, what some pro-immigration arguments get wrong, why he’s more concerned about companies like Facebook and Google than he is Walmart and Amazon, the merits of a human rights approach to privacy, whether the EU treats tech companies fairly, having Matt Damon as a college roommate, the future of fintech, his highest objective when teaching economics, what he learned from coauthoring a paper with someone who disagrees with him, why he’s a prolific Goodreads reviewer, and more.</p> <p class=""p1"">Follow us on <a href= ""https://twitter.com/cowenconvos""><span class= ""s1"">Twitter</span></a> and <a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/""><span class= ""s1"">IG</span></a>: @cowenconvos</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s2"">Email: <a href= ""mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu""><span class= ""s3"">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</span></a></span></p> <p class=""p1"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/jasonfurman"">Jason</a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""p1"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/tylercowen""><span class=""s1"">Tyler</span></a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://facebook.com/cowenconvos"">Facebook</a></span></p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://mercatus.org/newsletters"">Newsletter</a></span></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/8/d/7/3/8d7377ea68b119cd/CWT-90-Furman-libsyn-v2.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/CWT-090-JasonFurman-podcast-v1.mp3?dest-id=850607,False

What gives American companies an edge over their competitors on the international stage? What value do management consultants really provide? Stanford professor Nick Bloom’s research studies how management practices, productivity techniques, and uncertainty shape outcomes across companies and countries.</p> <p>He joined Tyler for a conversation about which areas of science are making progress, the factors that have made research more expensive, why government should invest more in R&D, how lean management transformed manufacturing, how India’s congested legal system inhibits economic development, the effects of technology on Scottish football hooliganism, why firms thrive in China, how weak legal systems incentivize nepotism, why he’s not worried about the effects of remote work on American productivity (in the short-term), the drawbacks of elite graduate programs, how his first “academic love” shapes his work today, the benefits of working with co-authors, why he prefers periodicals and podcasts to reading books, and more.</p> <p class=""p1"">Follow us on <a href= ""https://twitter.com/cowenconvos""><span class= ""s1"">Twitter</span></a> and <a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/""><span class= ""s1"">IG</span></a>: @cowenconvos</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s2"">Email: <a href= ""mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu""><span class= ""s3"">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</span></a></span></p> <p class=""p1"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/tylercowen""><span class=""s1"">Tyler</span></a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://facebook.com/cowenconvos"">Facebook</a></span></p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://mercatus.org/newsletters"">Newsletter</a></span></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/a/1/d/0/a1d0ddd13b7e99c1/CWT-106-Bloom-libsyn-v2.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/CWT-106-NicholasBloom-podcast-v1.mp3?dest-id=850607,False
5,Nathan Nunn on the Paths to Development,"<p>Nathan Nunn’s work history includes automotive stores, a freight company, a paint factory, a ski hill, photography, book publishing, private tutoring, and more. Having grown up in a lower-income Canadian family, he recognizes the importance of having multiple pathways to climb the socioeconomic ladder. Now, as a development economist at Harvard, his research investigates how things like history, culture and contract enforcement shape the development paths of nations.</p> <p>Nathan joined Tyler for a conversation about which African countries a theory of persistence would lead him to bet on, why so many Africans live in harder to settle areas, his predictions for the effects of Chinese development on East Africa, why genetic distance is a strong predictor of bilateral income differences and trade, the pleasant surprises of visiting the Democratic Republic of Congo, the role of the Catholic Church in the development of the West, why Canadian football is underrated, the unique commutes of Ottawans, the lack of Canadian brands, what’s missing from most economic graduate programs, the benefits of studying economics outside of the United States, how the plow shaped gender roles in the societies that used it, the cultural values behind South Korea’s success, and more.</p> <p class=""p1"">Follow us on <a href= ""https://twitter.com/cowenconvos""><span class= ""s1"">Twitter</span></a> and <a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/""><span class= ""s1"">IG</span></a>: @cowenconvos</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s2"">Email: <a href= ""mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu""><span class= ""s3"">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</span></a></span></p> <p class=""p1"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/DrNathanNunn"">Nathan</a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""p1"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/tylercowen""><span class=""s1"">Tyler</span></a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://facebook.com/cowenconvos"">Facebook</a></span></p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://mercatus.org/newsletters"">Newsletter</a></span></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/e/1/1/b/e11b24b54a58bee8/CWT-105-Nunn-libsyn.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/CWT-105-NathanNunn-podcast-v1.mp3?dest-id=850607,False
6,Melissa Dell on the Significance of Persistence,"<p class=""p1"">Explaining 10 percent of something is not usually cause for celebration. And yet when it comes to economic development, where so many factors are in play—institutions, culture, geography, to name a few—it’s impressive indeed. And that’s just what Melissa Dell has accomplished in her pathbreaking work. From the impact of the Mexican Revolution to the different development paths of northern and southern Vietnam, her work exploits what are often accidents of history—whether a Peruvian village was just inside or outside a mine’s catchment area, for example—to explain persistent differences in outcomes. Her work has earned numerous plaudits, including the John Bates Clark Medal earlier this year.</p> <p class=""p1"">On the 100th episode of <em>Conversations with Tyler</em>, Melissa joined Tyler to discuss what’s behind Vietnam’s economic performance, why persistence isn’t predictive, the benefits and drawbacks of state capacity, the differing economic legacies of forced labor in Indonesia and Peru, whether people like her should still be called a Rhodes scholar, if SATs are useful, the joys of long-distance running, why higher temps are bad for economic growth, how her grandmother cultivated her curiosity, her next project looking to unlock huge historical datasets, and more.</p> <p class=""p1"">Follow us on <a href= ""https://twitter.com/cowenconvos""><span class= ""s1"">Twitter</span></a> and <a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/""><span class= ""s1"">IG</span></a>: @cowenconvos</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s2"">Email: <a href= ""mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu""><span class= ""s3"">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</span></a></span></p> <p class=""p1"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/tylercowen""><span class=""s1"">Tyler</span></a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://facebook.com/cowenconvos"">Facebook</a></span></p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://mercatus.org/newsletters"">Newsletter</a></span></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/b/5/2/c/b52c442495b92478/CWT-103-Dell-libsyn-v2.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/CWT-103-MelissaDell-podcast-v1.mp3?dest-id=850607,False
7,"Annie Duke on Poker, Probabilities, and How We Make Decisions","<p class=""graf graf--p"">For Annie Duke, the poker table is a perfect laboratory to study human decision-making — including her own. “It really exposes you to the way that you’re thinking,” she says, “how hard it is to avoid decision traps, even when you’re perfectly well aware that those decision traps exist. And how easy it is for like your mind to slip into those traps.” She’s spent a lot of time studying human cognition at the poker table and off it — her best-known academic article is about psycholinguistics and her forthcoming <a href= ""https://www.amazon.com/How-Decide-Simple-Making-Choices/dp/0593084608""> book</a> is titled <em class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices</em>.</p> <p class=""graf graf--p"">Annie joined Tyler to explore how payoffs aren’t always monetary, the benefits and costs of probabilistic thinking, the “magical thinking” behind why people buy fire insurance but usually don’t get prenups, the psychology behind betting on shark migrations, how her most famous linguistics paper took on Steven Pinker, how public policy would change if only the top 500 poker players voted, why she wasn’t surprised to lose Celebrity Apprentice to Joan Rivers, whether Trump has a tell, the number one trait of top poker players, and more.</p> <p class=""p1"">Follow us on <a href= ""https://twitter.com/cowenconvos""><span class= ""s1"">Twitter</span></a> and <a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/""><span class= ""s1"">IG</span></a>: @cowenconvos</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s2"">Email: <a href= ""mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu""><span class= ""s3"">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</span></a></span></p> <p class=""p1"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/AnnieDuke"">Annie</a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""p1"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/tylercowen""><span class=""s1"">Tyler</span></a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://facebook.com/cowenconvos"">Facebook</a></span></p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://mercatus.org/newsletters"">Newsletter</a></span></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/4/6/0/0/4600865680ef0a3a/CWT-102-Duke-libsyn.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/CWT-102-AnnieDuke-podcast-v1.mp3?dest-id=850607,False
8,Rachel Harmon on Policing,"<p class=""p1"">Long before becoming a legal scholar focused on police reform, Rachel Harmon studied engineering at MIT and graduate philosophy at LSE. “You could call it a random walk,” she says, “or you could say that I’m really interested in the structure of things.” But despite her experience and training, even she can’t identify a single point of leverage that can radically reform the complicated system of policing in America. “We have been struggling with balancing the harms and benefits of policing since we started contemporary departments, so I don’t think that we’re going to suddenly fix this by flipping one lever.”</p> <p class=""p1"">She joined Tyler to discuss the best ideas for improving policing, including why good data on policing is so hard to come by, why body cams are not a panacea, the benefits and costs of consolidating police departments, why more female cops won’t necessarily reduce the use of force, how federal programs can sometimes misfire, where changing police selection criteria would and wouldn’t help, whether some policing could be replaced by social workers, the sobering frequency of sexual assaults by police, how a national accreditation system might improve police conduct, what reformers can learn from Camden and elsewhere, and more. They close by discussing the future of law schools, what she learned clerking under Guido Calabresi and Stephen Breyer, why she’s drawn to kickboxing and triathlons, and what two things she looks for in a young legal scholar.</p> <p class=""p1"">Follow us on <a href= ""https://twitter.com/cowenconvos""><span class= ""s1"">Twitter</span></a> and <a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/""><span class= ""s1"">IG</span></a>: @cowenconvos</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s2"">Email: <a href= ""mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu""><span class= ""s3"">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</span></a></span></p> <p class=""p1"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/tylercowen""><span class=""s1"">Tyler</span></a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://facebook.com/cowenconvos"">Facebook</a></span></p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://mercatus.org/newsletters"">Newsletter</a></span></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/c/7/a/e/c7aec32378b0d37b/CWT-104-Harmon-libsyn-v2.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/CWT-104-RachelHarmon-v1.mp3?dest-id=850607,False

Recently, he’s become an influential voice on Twitter documenting the pandemic-induced strain on the world’s financial systems.</p> <p class=""p1"">Adam joined Tyler to discuss the historically unusual decision to have a high-cost lockdown during a pandemic, why he believes in a swoosh-shaped recovery, portents of financial crises in China and the West, which emerging economies are currently most at risk, what Keynes got wrong about the Treaty of Versailles, why the Weimar Republic failed, whether Hitler was a Keynesian, the political and economic prospects of various EU members, his trick to writing a lot, how Twitter encourages him to read more, what he taught executives at BP, his advice for visiting Germany, and more.</p> <p class=""p1"">Follow us on <a href= ""https://twitter.com/cowenconvos""><span class= ""s1"">Twitter</span></a> and <a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/""><span class= ""s1"">IG</span></a>: @cowenconvos</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s2"">Email: <a href= ""mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu""><span class= ""s3"">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</span></a></span></p> <p class=""p1"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/adam_tooze"">Adam</a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""p1"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/tylercowen""><span class=""s1"">Tyler</span></a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://facebook.com/cowenconvos"">Facebook</a></span></p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://mercatus.org/newsletters"">Newsletter</a></span></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/5/5/c/c/55cc5cb93b8ff19e/CWT-098-Tooze-libsyn-v2.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/CWT-098-Tooze-podcast-v1.mp3?dest-id=850607,False

They also discuss academia’s responsibility to inform public discourse, how he’d apply his ideas on mechanism design to reform tenure and admissions, his unique intellectual journey from socialism to libertarianism and beyond, the common element that attracts him to both the movie <em>Memento</em> and Don McLean’s “American Pie,” what talent he looks for in young economists, the struggle to straddle the divide between academia and politics, the benefits and drawbacks of rollerblading to class, and more.</p> <p class=""p1"">Follow us on <a href= ""https://twitter.com/cowenconvos""><span class= ""s1"">Twitter</span></a> and <a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/""><span class= ""s1"">IG</span></a>: @cowenconvos</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s2"">Email: <a href= ""mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu""><span class= ""s3"">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</span></a></span></p> <p class=""p1"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/glenweyl"">Glen</a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""p1"">Follow <a href= ""https://twitter.com/tylercowen""><span class=""s1"">Tyler</span></a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://facebook.com/cowenconvos"">Facebook</a></span></p> <p class=""p2""><span class=""s3""><a href= ""https://mercatus.org/newsletters"">Newsletter</a></span></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/e/9/b/e/e9bee4ad151b6474/CWT-099-Weyl-libsyn-v2.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/CWT-099-GlenWeyl-podcast-v1.mp3?dest-id=850607,False

And Emily didn’t expect that it’d be boosting sales: “Why would anybody in their right mind want to read <em>Station Eleven</em> during a pandemic?” she wondered to Tyler. Her reaction was pure bafflement until she found herself renting <em>Contagion</em> and thought about why. “There’s just such a longing in times of uncertainty to see how it ends.” Narratives, especially familiar ones, soothe us.

30,Ted Gioia on Music as Cultural Cloud Storage,"<p>To Ted Gioia, music is a form of cloud storage for preserving human culture. And the real cultural conflict, he insists, is not between “high brow” and “low brow” music, but between the innovative and the formulaic. Imitation and repetition deaden musical culture—and he should know, since he listens to 3 hours of new music per day and over 1,000 newly released recordings in a year. His latest book covers the evolution of music from its origins in hunter-gatherer societies, to ancient Greece, to jazz, to its role in modern-day political protests such as those in Hong Kong.</p> <p>He joined Tyler to discuss the history and industry of music, including the reasons AI will never create the perfect songs, the strange relationship between outbreaks of disease and innovation, how the shift from record companies to Silicon Valley transformed incentive structures within the industry–and why that’s cause for concern, the vocal polyphony of Pygmy music, Bob Dylan’s Nobel prize, why input is underrated, his advice to aspiring music writers, the unsung female innovators of music history, how the Blues anticipated the sexual revolution, what Rene Girard’s mimetic theory can tell us about noisy restaurants, the reason he calls Sinatra the “Derrida of pop singing,” how to cultivate an excellent music taste, and why he loves Side B of Abbey Road.</p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/tedgioia"">Ted</a> on Twitter</p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/tylercowen"">Tyler</a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""graf graf--p"">More CWT goodness:</p> <p class=""graf graf--p""><a href= ""https://facebook.com/cowenconvos"">Facebook</a></p> <p class=""graf graf--p""><a href= ""https://twitter.com/cowenconvos"">Twitter</a></p> <p class=""graf graf--p""><a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/"">Instagram</a></p> <p class=""graf graf--p""><a href= ""https://mercatus.org/newsletters"">Email</a></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/2/3/4/6/23461dce13d76ad2/CWT-079-Gioia-libsyn.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/CWT_079_Gioia_audio_mixdown.mp3?dest-id=850607,False

34,Samantha Power on Learning How to Make a Difference,"<p class=""graf graf--p"">A former war correspondent and UN ambassador, Samantha Power has had her share of tough assignments. But writing a memoir about it all is also a daunting prospect. The format itself is a challenge: how do you convince the reader you’re worth spending time with?

This, along with a family scattered across half-a-dozen countries, establishes him as a true cosmopolitan, a label Appiah readily accepts. Yet he insists it is nonetheless possible to be a cosmopolitan patriot, rooted in a place, while having obligations and interests that transcend one’s national identity.</p> <p class=""graf graf--p"">He joins Tyler to discuss this worldly perspective and more, including whether Africa will secularize, Ghanian fallibilism, teaching Jodie Foster, whether museums should repatriate collections, Karl Popper, Lee Kuan Yew, which country has the best jollof rice, the value of writing an ethical advice column, E.T.

Though Stephenson insists he’s more often wrong than right, his technical sharpness has even led to <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href= ""https://reason.com/2019/06/05/if-we-told-you-neal-stephenson-invented-bitcoin-would-you-be-surprised/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-href= ""https://reason.com/2019/06/05/if-we-told-you-neal-stephenson-invented-bitcoin-would-you-be-surprised/""> a half-joking suggestion</a> that he might be Satoshi Nakamoto, the shadowy creator of bitcoin.

Might we be living in one, and does it even matter? Stephenson joins Tyler to discuss the book and more, including the future of physical surveillance, how clothing will evolve, the kind of freedom you could expect on a Mars colony, whether today’s media fragmentation is trending us towards dystopia, why the Apollo moon landings were communism’s greatest triumph, whether we’re in a permanent secular innovation starvation, Leibniz as a philosopher, Dickens and Heinlein as writers, and what storytelling has to do with giving good driving directions.</p> <p class=""graf graf--p""><a href= ""https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/tyler-cowen-neal-stephenson-science-fiction-writer-7fbe020e60b6""> Transcript and links</a></p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://www.twitter.com/nealstephenson"">Neal</a> on Twitter</p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/tylercowen"">Tyler</a> on Twitter</p> <p class=""graf graf--p"">More CWT goodness:</p> <p class=""graf graf--p""><a href= ""https://facebook.com/cowenconvos"">Facebook</a></p> <p class=""graf graf--p""><a href= ""https://twitter.com/cowenconvos"">Twitter</a></p> <p class=""graf graf--p""><a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/"">Instagram</a></p> <p class=""graf graf--p""><a href= ""https://mercatus.org/newsletters"">Email</a></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/0/a/a/0/0aa0203ff007a968/CWT-071-NealStephenson-libsyn.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/CWT-071-NealStephenson-podcast-v2.mp3?dest-id=850607,False
39,"Eric Kaufmann on Immigration, Identity, and the Limits of Individualism","<p class=""graf graf--p"">Going back and forth between Canada and Japan during his childhood sparked Eric Kaufmann’s interest in the question of identity. As a foreigner in an international school, he encountered young individuals from at least 60 other countries, and this made him think more about national identity and how people affiliate and interact with one another. Now as an academic, he explores how demographic changes — most notably caused by ethnic migration and assimilation — are the key to understanding Brexit, Trump, and pretty much every major issue du jour.</p> <p class=""graf graf--p"">Kauffman’s latest book <em class= ""markup--em markup--p-em"">Whiteshift,</em> which examines how declining white ethnic majorities will respond to these changes, is on Tyler’s list as one of the best books of the year.

And she’s often drawn to write about the individual thinking behind extreme altruism, dementia care, and whether to stay in a small town. Motivating her is a desire to place readers inside someone’s head: to see what they see and to think how they think.</p> <p class=""graf graf--p"">In their dialogue, Larissa and Tyler discuss the thinking and thinkers behind her profiles, essays, and books, including notions of moral luck, exit vs voice, the prose of Kenneth Tynan, why altruistic heroes are mainly found in genre fiction, why she avoids describing physical appearances in her writing, the circumstances that push humans to live more extraordinary lives, what today has in common with the 1890s, and more.</p> <p class=""graf graf--p""><a href= ""https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/tyler-cowen-larissa-macfarquhar-writing-altruism-e4767f7bb78d""> Transcript and links</a></p> <p class=""graf graf--p"">Follow <a href= ""https://www.twitter.com/larissamacfarqu"">Larissa</a> on Twitter</p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/tylercowen"">Tyler</a> on Twitter</p> <p>More CWT goodness:</p> <p><a href=""https://facebook.com/cowenconvos"">Facebook</a></p> <p><a href=""https://twitter.com/cowenconvos"">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/"">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href=""https://mercatus.org/newsletters"">Email</a></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/b/4/c/7/b4c70312039e95e9/CWT-058-LarissaMacFarquhar-podart.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/CWT-058-LarissaMacFarquhar-v1.mp3?dest-id=850607,False

Our widespread and ancient desire to use nature to change our consciousness.</p> <p>He joins Tyler to discuss his research and experience with psychedelics, including what kinds of people most benefit from them, what it can teach us about profundity, how it can change your personality and political views, the importance of culture in shaping the experience, the proper way to integrate it into mainstream practice, and - most importantly of all - whether it's any fun.</p> <p><a href= ""https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/michael-pollan-tyler-cowen-nature-euphoria-food-22145fd728a2""> Transcript and links</a></p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/michaelpollan"">Michael</a> on Twitter</p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/tylercowen"">Tyler</a> on Twitter</p> <p>More CWT goodness:</p> <p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/cowenconvos/"">Facebook</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/cowenconvos"">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/"">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.mercatus.org/newsletters"">Email</a></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/2/2/7/7/2277ae7f9bd415a8/artworks-000403714059-u9mzuo-original.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/485868771-conversationswithtyler-tyler-cowen-michael-pollan-science-sublimity-psychedelics.mp3?dest-id=850607,False
64,Michelle Dawson on Autism and Atypicality,"<p>Perhaps no one else in the world more appreciates the challenges facing a better understanding of autism than Michelle Dawson. An autistic herself, she began researching her condition after experiencing discrimination at her job. ""Because I had to address these legal issues and questions,"" she tells Tyler, ""I did actually look at the autism literature, and suddenly I had information I could really work with. Suddenly there it was, this information that I was supposed to be too stupid to work with."" And so she continued reading papers - lots and lots of papers - and is now an influential researcher in her own right.</p> <p>For Michelle, the best way to understand autism is to think of it as atypical information processing. Autistic brains function differently, and these highly varied divergences lead to biases and misunderstanding among typical thinkers, including autism researchers.</p> <p>In her conversation with Tyler, she outlines the current thinking on autism, including her ideas about cognitive versatility and optionality, hyperlexia and other autistic strengths, why different tests yield wildly different measures of IQ among autistics, her 'massive bias' against segregating autistics, how autistic memory is different, why sometimes a triangle is just a freaking triangle, and more.</p> <p><a href= ""https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/tyler-cowen-michelle-dawson-autism-research-dsm-f2a41b326e76""> Transcript and links</a></p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/autismcrisis"">Michelle</a> on Twitter</p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/tylercowen"">Tyler</a> on Twitter</p> <p>More CWT goodness:</p> <p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/cowenconvos/"">Facebook</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/cowenconvos"">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/"">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.mercatus.org/newsletters"">Email</a></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/a/1/c/fa1ceda570ccab39/artworks-000403715577-pkjjco-original.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/479639382-conversationswithtyler-michelle-dawson-tyler-cowen-autism-research-atypicality.mp3?dest-id=850607,False

And the latest book, *The Wizard and the Prophet: Two Remarkable Scientists and their Dueling Visions to Shape Tomorrow’s World*, is no exception, which Tyler calls one of the best overall frameworks for thinking about environmentalism and the limits to growth.</p> <p>In the course of their chat, Tyler and Charles cover pollution, why the environmental impact of beef might be overstated, what fixed factor might ultimately constrain growth (and if there is one), Jared Diamond and Bjorn Lomberg, the underrated political genius of Cortes, his top tip for appreciating Robert Frost, and why Andrew Jackson didn’t have to be such a jerk.</p> <p><a href= ""https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/tyler-cowen-charles-mann-environment-agriculture-engineering-621327588c64""> Transcript and links</a></p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/charlescmann"">Charles</a> on Twitter</p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/tylercowen"">Tyler</a> on Twitter</p> <p>More CWT goodness:</p> <p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/cowenconvos/"">Facebook</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/cowenconvos"">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/"">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.mercatus.org/newsletters"">Email</a></p> <p> </p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/b/2/c/0/b2c093b1d3a31438/artworks-000403754154-m199p7-original.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/392359533-conversationswithtyler-charles-c-mann-tyler-cowen-environment-world.mp3?dest-id=850607,False
78,Ross Douthat on Narrative and Religion (Live at Mason),"<p>Last year, Tyler asked his readers “What Is the Strongest Argument for the Existence of God?” and followed up a few days later with a post outlining why he doesn’t believe in God. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat accepted the implicit challenge, responding to the second post in dialogic form and arguing that theism warrants further consideration.</p> <p>This in-person dialogue starts along similar lines, covering Douthat’s views on religion and theology, but then moves on to more earth-bound concerns, such as his stance on cats, The Wire vs The Sopranos, why Watership Down is the best modern novel for understanding politics, eating tofu before it was cool, journalism as a trade, why he’s open to weird ideas, the importance of Sam’s Club Republicans, the specter of a Buterlian Jihad, and more.</p> <p><a href= ""https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/ross-douthat-tyler-cowen-religion-catholicism-narrative-7721eb7b028b""> Transcript and links</a></p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/douthatnyt"">Ross</a> on Twitter</p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/tylercowen"">Tyler</a> on Twitter</p> <p>More CWT goodness:</p> <p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/cowenconvos/"">Facebook</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/cowenconvos"">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/"">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.mercatus.org/newsletters"">Email</a></p> <p> </p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/5/5/1/4/5514a78b03b0c536/artworks-000403767432-467bp1-original.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/384935537-conversationswithtyler-tyler-cowen-ross-douthat-narrative-religion.mp3?dest-id=850607,False

In an era of low tariffs, what margins matter most for trade liberalization? Do investor arbitration panels override national sovereignty? And, what’s the connection between free trade and world peace?</p> <p>They also discuss the revolution as America’s Brexit, why NAFTA is an ‘effing great’ trade agreement, Jagdish Bhagwati’s key influence on Doug, the protectionist bent of the Boston Tea Party, the future of the WTO, Trump, China, the Chicago School, and what’s rotten in the state of New Hampshire.</p> <p><a href= ""https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/doug-irwin-tyler-cowen-clashing-over-commerce-a-history-of-us-trade-policy-29bc5fe3ad21""> Transcript and links</a></p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/d_a_irwin"">Doug</a> on Twitter</p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/tylercowen"">Tyler</a> on Twitter</p> <p>More CWT goodness:</p> <p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/cowenconvos/"">Facebook</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/cowenconvos"">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/"">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.mercatus.org/newsletters"">Email</a></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/3/e/a/9/3ea97c2249b5b0ca/artworks-000403772874-bra7dd-original.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/362473244-conversationswithtyler-doug-irwin-trade-policy.mp3?dest-id=850607,False

In her memoir Ants Among Elephants, she explores the antiquities of her mother, her uncles, and other members of her family against modern India’s landscape. Through this book she redeemed the value of her family’s memories, understanding her family’s stories were not those of shame, but did reveal to the world the truth of India and its caste system.</p> <p>During her conversation with Tyler, they discuss the nature and persistence of caste, gender issues in India, her New York City lifestyle, religion, living in America versus living in India, Bob Dylan and Dalit music, American identity politics, the nature of Marxism, and why she left her job at the Bank of New York to become a New York City Subway conductor.</p> <p><a href= ""https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/sujatha-gidla-ants-among-elephants-tyler-cowen-bd11b423ba91""> Transcript and links</a></p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/gidla_sujatha"">Sujatha</a> on Twitter</p> <p>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/tylercowen"">Tyler</a> on Twitter</p> <p>More CWT goodness:</p> <p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/cowenconvos/"">Facebook</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/cowenconvos"">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href= ""https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/"">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.mercatus.org/newsletters"">Email</a></p>",https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/e/7/2/fe720ea75c465ddc/artworks-000403773672-fz949k-original.jpg,https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/cowenconvos/356124602-conversationswithtyler-sujatha-gidla-tyler-cowen.mp3?dest-id=850607,False
